name="Edit Resources as Spreadsheet"
description="Edit Many Resources from one Folder as a table.

Heavily inspired by Multi-Cursor-Editing in text editors, so after selecting multiple cells (in the same column!) using Ctrl+Click or Shift+Click, most Basic-to-Intermediate movements should be available."
